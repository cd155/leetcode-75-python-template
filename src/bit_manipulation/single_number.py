LeetCode 136: Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that
single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

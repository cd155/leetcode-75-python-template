LeetCode 994: Rotting Oranges

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
- 0 representing an empty cell,
- 1 representing a fresh orange, or
- 2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is
impossible, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting
only happens 4-directionally.

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.

Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10
- grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.

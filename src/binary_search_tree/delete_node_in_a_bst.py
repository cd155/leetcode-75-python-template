LeetCode 450: Delete Node in a BST

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST.
Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

Example 1:
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it. One valid
answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]. Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- Each node has a unique value.
- root is a valid binary search tree.
- -10^5 <= key <= 10^5
